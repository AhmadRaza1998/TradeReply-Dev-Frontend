            <h4>Information We Collect</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Personal Information:</strong> You are not required to
              create an account to use some of our services. When you create an
              account, we require collection of personal information such as
              your name and email address. We may also require your account
              information of social services if you choose to connect them, such
              as Facebook, Google, and Apple. Free subscriptions do not require
              payment details; however, paid subscriptions will require these
              payment details, which will include your name and postal address.
              While not mandatory, we may also collect your phone number in
              which case it will need to be verified. This information is
              necessary to provide you with our services and to ensure a
              personalized experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you register for one of our paid subscriptions, (Essential,
              Plus, Premium), our third-party payment processor will also
              process information about your payment card and bank account
              information or payment account information that we require for the
              purpose of capturing and processing your account creation.

              <strong>Internal Marketplace:</strong> When you use our internal
              marketplace to purchase digital and physical products, we collect
              information such as your name, contact details, shipping address,
              and payment information to process transactions and provide
              customer support. Transaction data, including product
              descriptions, prices, and dates, is recorded to manage orders and
              support returns or disputes. Sellers must provide contact details,
              payment information, and product listings to facilitate
              transactions. Relevant transaction information may be shared with
              payment processors and shipping carriers, and limited data may be
              shared with sellers for order fulfillment. All payment
              transactions are securely processed using industry-standard
              encryption, and payment card information is not stored on our
              servers. Users can manage their personal information and
              transaction history through account settings and contact support
              for account deletion or data inquiries. We retain transaction
              records to comply with legal obligations, including tax laws and
              financial regulations, typically for up to 10 years. For more
              details or concerns about our data handling practices, please
              contact our support team.

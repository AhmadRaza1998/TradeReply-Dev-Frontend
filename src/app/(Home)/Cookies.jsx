            At TradeReply LLC (“TradeReply”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), we use
            cookies and similar technologies to enhance your experience on our
            website www.tradereply.com (“Site”), provide you with personalized
            content, and understand how our services are used. This Cookies
            Policy ("Cookies Policy") is a part of our{" "}
            <Link href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</Link>, and it explains what
            cookies are, how we use them, and how you can control your cookie
            preferences.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you first visit the Site, you will be prompted to consent to
            the use of cookies in accordance with this Cookies Policy. If you
            accept, we will store them on your computer. We highly recommend
            that you do not decline the cookies to ensure you have the best

            <h4>What Are Cookies?</h4>
            <p>
              ‘Cookies’ or singular ‘Cookie’ are small text files sent to your
              browser and stored on your device (computer, tablet, or mobile)
              when you visit a website. They help websites remember your actions
              and preferences (such as login details, language, and other
              settings) over a period of time, so you don’t have to re-enter
              them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to
              another.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Site uses first party cookies (those set by a website the user
              is visiting, such as{" "}
              <a
                rel="noreferrer"
                href="http://www.tradereply.com"
                target="_blank"
              >
                www.tradereply.com
              </a>
              ) and third-party cookies (those set by a different domain) such
              as Google, Facebook, X, and other solutions we are integrated
              with. We will explain this in more detail below.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cookies may be stored on your computer for varying lengths of
              time. They can exist as either "session cookies" or "persistent
              cookies." A session cookie only lasts during the browser session
              and is automatically removed when you close your browser. A
              persistent cookie remains long after the browser is closed and
              will stay until it expires (as set by the third party responsible
              for placing it) or until you delete it. Persistent cookies help
              websites recognize and identify your computer when you reopen your
              browser and continue surfing the Internet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Information collected through cookies may include details such as
              the IP (Internet Protocol) address of your device, browser type,
              language, operating system, the state or country from which you
              accessed the Site, the date and time of your visit(s), the number
              of links you click on the Site, the functions you use, the
              searches you perform, and the data you save while on the Site.
              TradeReply may use the information collected for various
              necessary, legitimate purposes, including user authentication,
              user interface customization, security, research and analysis to
              enhance the functionality of our Site, and advertising. For more
              information on how we use your data, please read our{" "}

            <h4>How We Use Cookies</h4>
            <p>The Site uses cookies for various purposes, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Necessary Cookies:</strong> These cookies are necessary
                for a Site to function and cannot be refused or switched off in
                our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions
                you take, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in,
                accessing secure areas, enabling pop-up functionality, or
                filling out forms.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Performance Cookies:</strong> We highly recommend you
                leave these cookies on. They are utilized to recognize website
                statistics based on user activities, such as page views, time
                spent on page, click data such as heatmaps, and tracking
                conversions. These cookies help us understand the strong and
                weak components of the Site, such as those that help us
                determine user experience and/or what Site components are
                causing issues, and without them we will not have insight into
                improving the Site for users.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Advertising cookies (ad cookies):</strong> These cookies
                are utilized to enable advertising features that are relevant to
                you.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>3rd Party Services Cookies:</strong> These are cookies
                utilized to integrate third-party features on the Site, such as
                social media pixel cookies, YouTube cookies used to store user
                preferences on videos, and cookies related to enabling
                functionality for the Help Desk and chat features on the Site.
                The Site has limited control over third-party cookies because
                these cookies are set and managed by external domains that the
                Site does not directly control. You can disable these cookies
                (although we don’t recommend it) on your browser. Below you will
                find how to disable cookies for the most popular web browsers:

            <h4>Web Beacons</h4>
            <p>
              TradeReply uses web beacons (also known as pixel tags, tracking
              pixels, or clear GIFs) to monitor user interactions and gather
              data about how our site is used. Web beacons are small,
              transparent images embedded in our web pages and emails that help
              us track activities such as page visits and email opens. Unlike
              cookies, which are stored on your device, web beacons are part of
              the content itself and allow for real-time tracking of user
              behavior. We partner with both Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and Google
              Tag Manager (GTM) who use web beacons to collect and manage data,
              providing us with valuable insights into site performance and user
              engagement. The information generated from Web Beacons relating to
              our Site is used for necessary and legitimate purposes, including
              understanding how our Site is being used as well as implementing
              and improving services. For more information on how both Google
              and we use your data, please read our{" "}

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Where To Advertise:</strong> Our approved partners can
                use any site or platform for their posts including but not
                limited to 3rd party sites, blogs, social networks, webinars, or
                live events or institutions where their links can be shared.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Accepted Locations:</strong> We accept traffic from all
                countries and there are no restricted regions for conducting
                marketing activities. However, due to service limitations in
                certain areas, such as Iran, we are currently unable to support
                residents in those locations.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Trademark Keywords: </strong> Our partners are
                prohibited from running paid marketing campaigns (including but
                not limited to pay-per-click) that include our branded trademark
                and trademark+ keywords in any format or language such as
                TradeReply.com, TradeReply, Trade Reply, and Trading Reply, in
                addition to being prohibited from using our logo in paid
                marketing.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Brand Guidelines:</strong> Adhere to TradeReply's brand
                guidelines when creating or sharing content. Maintain the
                integrity and consistency of the TradeReply brand. Always use
                our branded logos, unaltered, directly from our{" "}
                <Link href="/brand-assets">Media Kit</Link>.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Retargeting & Remarketing:</strong> Retargeting or
                remarketing is not considered as paid user acquisition.
                Affiliates will not be rewarded for users who return to
                TradeReply via our own retargeting or remarketing efforts, as
                this is considered a channel conflict. Commissions are only
                awarded for new users directly referred through the affiliate's
                unique referral link. This means users who are referred to our
                site from an affiliate link and do not convert to a
                subscription, but then later return through our own remarketing
                efforts while within the affiliate referral’s attribution window
                will not count as an affiliate conversion.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Discounts & Promos:</strong> It is not allowed to offer
                coupons, discounts, or special offers in your messaging unless
                such promotions were specifically authorized by TradeReply.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Self-Referrals:</strong> Purchasing a TradeReply
                subscription through one's own referral link is prohibited and
                goes against our partner program. This behavior will not be
                rewarded and will result in no commission, and termination of
                our affiliate partnership and your TradeReply account due to
                deception and attempting to tamper with the integrity of our
                partner program.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Multiple Accounts:</strong> It is forbidden to have more
                than one account.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Commission Structure:</strong> Commissions are earned
                based on the subscription level of the referred user during
                their first month. Depending on subscription level, you will
                receive a fixed amount of $10-$30 for every first monthly
                subscription purchased by a referred user, and $60-$100 for
                their first annual subscription.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Payment Schedule:</strong> Commissions are paid within
                30 days after the end of each month. They are typically sent
                within the first 2 weeks of the following month. Any payouts
                submitted after the 20th of a month will be processed in the
                following month’s payment cycle.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Payout Method:</strong> All commissions are paid
                exclusively through PayPal only. You need a PayPal account to
                receive your payment. Failure to provide your PayPal email will
                result in rejection of payouts.

                <strong>Fraud Prevention:</strong> TradeReply reserves the right
                to withhold commissions and terminate partnerships if fraudulent
                activity is detected. Fraudulent activity includes but is not
                limited to self-referrals.
